Problem 1 :

// You have an odd array (array with odd numbers). [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ]. Now convert this array into an even array (array with evennumbers). [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]. Do this using for loop & array.map() method. Hints: add one to any odd number and it will become an even number.

Problem 2 :
// You are given an array say: [33, 50, 79, 78, 90, 101, 30 ]. Now return/get all the elements which are divisible by 10 using array.filter() method
// Now do the same task of question 2. But do this using array.find() method. Then compare the output of question 2 & question 3.

Problem 3 : 
// You have an array [ 1, 9, 17, 22 ]. Add the all elements of this array and give output. Do this using for loop & array.reduce() method.

Challenge 1 : 
// Challenging Follow above array of objects. So, you have 3 objects asarray element. Can you find out the total sum from here? 20 + 15 + 22 = 57 . The output will be 57 What are you thinking? Yeah! Do it with for loop. I know you can do it. But! Wait !! Wait !!! Do the same task using array.reduce() method.

Challenge 3 :
// Console the value of email ● Console the value of address ● Console the value of city ● Console the value of lat ● Console the value of company name
